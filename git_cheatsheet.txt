Branch Operations
You can do the following with branch:

Creating new branch: git checkout -b <branch-name>
Pushing branch from local to remote repo: git push origin <branch-name>
Renaming branch:
Renaming local branch: git branch -m old-name new-name
Renaming remote branch: git push origin :old-name new-name
Deleting branch:
Deleting local branch: git branch -d <branch-name>
Deleting remote branch: git push origin -d <branch-name>

Cheat Sheet
git merge <branch>: Merges <branch> to current branch
git rebase <base>: Rebases the current branch onto the base (branch name, commit ID, tag)
git rebase -i <base>: Performs interactive rebase. Launches editor where you can specify command on each commit to transform it.
git rebase --abort: Cancels rebasing and goes back to the previous commit
git rebase --continue: Continues rebasing after resolving the rebase conflicts
git pull --rebase: Fetches the remote copy and rebases it into the current branch of the local copy
